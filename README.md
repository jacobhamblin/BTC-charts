# BTC-charts

BTC-charts is an aggregation of up-to-date bitcoin statistics, visualized, and rendered on a simple UI.

- Hits the [Bitcoin Average API](https://bitcoinaverage.com/api) for price and volume organized by exchange, as well as brief and long-term price histories.
- Utilizes Highcharts API to display the data in useful ways.
- Renders with React.js.

The alignment of my desire to make meaningful data-driven decisions and my
interest in bitcoin led me to build the product. I've been following bitcoin for a few years now and want to understand its inner workings better, and figure that spending time examining its behavior will bring deeper comprehension as well.

Thanks for the awesome API, Bitcoin Average team!
