# BTC-charts

BTC-charts is an aggregation of up-to-date bitcoin statistics, visualized, and rendered on a simple UI.

As a bitcoin user, I've been interested in the protocol and perplexed by its inner workings for a while now. I want to understand the technology better, as well as some of the factors that contribute to the volatility of its worth. I made this as a means to tackle the latter and approach the former.

I made this using:
- [Bitcoin Average API](https://bitcoinaverage.com/api) for price and volume organized by exchange, as well as brief and long-term price histories.
- Highcharts to display the data in useful ways.
- React.js for modular and efficient view rendering.

Thanks for the awesome API, Bitcoin Average team!
